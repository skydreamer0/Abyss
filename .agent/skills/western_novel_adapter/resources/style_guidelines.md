# Style Guidelines for Western Progression Fantasy / LitRPG

This document supplements the `Western Novel Adapter` skill. It provides specific stylistic references and rules based on top-performing novels on platforms like Royal Road.

## 1. Character & Voice (角色與語氣)

*   **Proactivity over Reactivity:** The MC (Main Character) should be active. They make decisions, even wrong ones, rather than simply letting the plot happen to them.
*   **The "Sensible" MC:** A common trope is a protagonist who applies modern logic or extreme pragmatism to a magical/fantasy situation. They should analyze threats rather than simply panicking.
*   **Internal Monologue Formatting:** Use *italics* for direct, word-for-word internal thoughts.
    *   *Bad:* He thought that the monster was too big and he should run.
    *   *Good:* He stared at the towering beast. *Yeah, nope. Time to leave.*

## 2. Prose & Formatting (文筆與排版)

*   **The "Windowpane" Prose:** The prose should act as a clear window to the action, not a stained-glass window drawing attention to itself. Avoid "purple prose" (overly ornate language).
*   **Vary Sentence Length:** Use short, punchy sentences during combat or high tension. Use longer, flowing sentences during descriptive or contemplative moments.
    *   *Combat Example:* He dodged right. The beast's claws sheared through the air where his head had been. He thrust his spear. Impact. Blood sprayed.
*   **Paragraph Size:** Keep paragraphs relatively short. Large walls of text are intimidating, especially for mobile readers (who make up a large portion of the audience).

## 3. Progression & "The System" (成長與反饋)

Even if the story isn't a strict LitRPG with stats, the feeling of *Progression Fantasy* must be maintained.
*   **Clear Milestones:** When the MC learns a new skill, breaks through a bottleneck, or gains an item, it must feel earned and its effects clearly stated.
*   **Sensory Magic:** When describing magic or leveling up, use sensory details. Does the mana feel like icy water? Does the level-up bring a euphoric rush followed by exhaustion?
*   **Crunchy vs. Creamy:**
    *   *Crunchy LitRPG:* Lots of stat blocks, math, and detailed system messages.
    *   *Creamy LitRPG/Progression:* Less math, more conceptual growth (e.g., reaching the "Silver Core Stage"). Provide the satisfying feedback without bogging down the pacing.

## 4. The Hook & The Cliffhanger (懸念設計)

*   **Micro-Hooks:** At the end of a scene break within a chapter, leave a small dangling thread.
*   **The Chapter Ending Cliffhanger:** A staple of serialized fiction.
    *   *Type A: Imminent Danger:* "The shadow in the corner wasn't a shadow. It was smiling."
    *   *Type B: The Revelation:* "The artifact glowed pulse-blue—the exact color of his supposed-dead master's eyes."
    *   *Type C: The Crucial Choice:* "He looked at the two doors. Both promised death, but only one promised answers. He took a breath and pushed open the left."
