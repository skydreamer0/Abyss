## Chapter 4｜三方簽封
# Chapter 4: The Tripartite Seal

第三十七基地的底部，存在著一個在官方地圖上被徹底抹除的盲腸區段。
At the absolute base of Base 37, there existed a vestigial sector—a "blind gut" that had been systematically scrubbed from every official map.

這裡被稱為「禁區入口」，位在基地最古老、最深層的一段環形廊道盡頭。周圍的合金牆壁厚得猶如末日掩體，沒有任何通風口的白噪音，也沒有維生系統的輕微震動。這裡安靜得可怕，連活人走動的腳步聲、甚至是呼吸聲，都會被這吸音的沉重結構吃掉一大半，剩下的只有在胸腔裡沉悶打鼓的心跳。
They called it the "Gateline to the Forbidden Zone." It sat at the terminus of a ring-corridor in the base's oldest, deepest strata. The surrounding alloy walls were thick enough to serve as a doomsday bunker, devoid of the white noise of ventilation or the faint vibration of life support. The silence was predatory. It consumed the sound of footsteps and even the rhythm of breathing, leaving nothing behind but the heavy, muffled drumbeat of a human heart in a hollow chest.

祁渡、沈洛、段九、以及祈函，這四個剛剛經歷了一場生死劫難的人，此刻正神情各異地站在同一扇高達七公尺的鉛灰色巨門前。
Alex, Shen Luo, Duan Jiu, and Qi Han—four survivors of a near-total collapse—stood before a seven-meter-tall slab of lead-grey steel. Their expressions varied, but the weight of the moment was shared.

在他們身後，還站著三名面無表情、猶如精密儀器般的見證員，分別代表軍方最高統帥部、教團長老院，以及黑市聯合仲裁所。
Behind them stood three Proxies, faceless and functional as precision instruments. They represented the three pillars of the base's power: the Military High Command, the Order's Council of Elders, and the Scavenger Syndicate’s Joint Arbiters.

那扇鉛灰色的巨門上沒有任何現代化的電子螢幕或虹膜掃描器。光禿禿的金屬表面上，只用一種最古老也最暴力的雷射刻印技術，深深地烙印著一行彷彿在滴血的警告字元：
There were no high-tech retina scanners or sleek touchscreens on the lead-grey monolith. Instead, the bare metal was scarred by an ancient, violent laser-etching process. The words looked as though they were bleeding into the steel:

**第零維修井。非最高層級聯合授權，任何人不得開啟。違者就地格殺。**
**[MAINTENANCE WELL ZERO. ACCESS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN WITHOUT TRIPARTITE AUTHORIZATION. LETHAL FORCE AUTHORIZED.]**

這就是那名被活體收容的失名者，在昏迷前用自己的鮮血拼死留下的座標終點。
This was the destination—the final coordinate the nameless man had carved in his own blood before the comatose dark took him.

「三方簽封程序，現在啟動。請依序進行。」
"The Tripartite Seal Protocol is now active. Proceed in sequence."

打破死寂的，是軍方見證員毫無起伏的聲音。他戴著防生化手套，手裡捧著一台古老的密碼驗證終端。
The military Proxy broke the silence, his voice a flat, bureaucratic monotone. He wore high-grade biohazard gloves, cradling an archaic-looking cipher-verification terminal.

這個被稱為「簽封」的權力解鎖流程，比祁渡想像中還要緩慢、繁瑣、且充滿了令人窒息的政治猜忌。這扇鉛灰色的巨門上一共嵌著九道獨立的物理與電子複合鎖。
The "Seal" process was far slower and more agonizingly pedantic than Alex had expected. It was a dance of political paranoia. The massive door was held shut by nine independent locks—a mix of physical tumblers and electronic deadbolts.

每開啟並解除一道鎖的防禦機制，都需要軍、教、黑市三方的見證員同時插入三枚經過加密的物理簽章；同時，沈洛、祈函與段九三人，還必須對著記錄儀進行三份完全無干擾的獨立聲紋口述；最後，還要由三台不同角度的高解析度攝影機進行三次全程無死角的錄影存證。
Every single lock required the simultaneous insertion of three encrypted physical keys from the military, the Order, and the Scavengers. Shen Luo, Qi Han, and Duan Jiu each had to provide independent voice-authentication logs to the black box recorder. All of this was overseen by three high-definition orbital cameras, ensuring zero blind spots for foul play.

沒有人敢催促。在這個充滿未知的深淵門前，每個人都怕自己因為一個輕微的動作而被提前追究開啟禁區的責任，但也同樣害怕自己的動作慢了半拍，而被其他兩方搶先拿到隱藏在門後的致命證據。
No one dared to rush the process. Standing at the threshold of the abyss, everyone was terrified of taking the blame for whatever they were about to wake up. At the same time, they were equally terrified that a moment's hesitation would let a rival faction seize whatever lethal secrets lay behind the steel first.

段九百無聊賴地靠在一旁滿是鐵鏽斑駁的牆壁上，他把玩著手裡那把剛剛用來發射電擊釘的改裝槍，突然壓低了聲音，對著站在他不遠處的祁渡冷笑道：
Duan Jiu leaned against a rusted, pitted section of the wall, looking entirely bored. He toyed with his jury-rigged nail gun—the same one that had neutralized the nameless man—and leaned toward Alex, his voice a low, cold rasp.

「看見沒，菜鳥？好好學著點。在這個見鬼的底下，最稀缺的資源從來都不是乾淨的飲水和氧氣，而是名正言順的『背鍋名額』。他們現在這副嚴肅的樣子，不是在開門，而是在精密地計算，等一下如果門裡跑出什麼不該有的東西，該怎麼把責任完美地推到對方頭上。」
"You see that, rookie? Take notes. Down here, the rarest resource isn't clean water or recycled air—it's someone to take the goddamn fall. Look at them. They aren't trying to open a door; they’re running a thousand simulations in their heads, calculating how to blame the other guy if something crawls out of that room and bites their heads off."

祁渡沒有回話。他的視線死死釘在那扇門上。
Alex didn't respond. He couldn't. His eyes were glued to the door.

他感覺不到周圍的寒冷，因為他後頸上那塊被沈洛貼上去的「語詞與神經監測貼片」，此刻正猶如一塊燒紅的木炭般，持續不斷地發出高頻的灼熱感。
He didn't feel the chill of the corridor. He didn't feel the fear of the shadows. The neural-impulse patch Shen Luo had slapped onto the back of his neck was vibrating with a high-frequency heat, like a piece of glowing charcoal pressed into his spine.

那股刺痛像是一根無形的絞索，在無聲地提醒他：無論這扇門後有什麼，他祁渡現在依然是一個沒有名字、掛在軍方高危險觀察名單上、隨時可能被「洗腦」或「處理」的邊緣人。
The stinging pain was a silent hangman's noose, reminding him of his status. No matter what secrets lay behind that steel, Alex was still a nameless asset on a high-risk watchlist—a disposable ghost waiting to be "scrubbed" at the first sign of a twitch.

「喀啦——」
*CLANK.*

長達二十分鐘的折磨後，第七道最為複雜的黃銅色齒輪鎖終於在沉悶的摩擦聲中解開。
After twenty minutes of clinical torture, the seventh lock—a massive brass gear-assembly—finally clicked open with a groan of unlubricated metal.

就在這時，一直在他們頭頂靜默運作的全能 AI「鹽井」，那毫無感情的合成機械音突然毫無預兆地從天花板隱藏的喇叭裡響起，震得所有人耳膜發麻：
The moment the gear stopped turning, "Salt Well," the base's overarching AI, broke its silence. The synthetic, inorganic voice boomed from the hidden ceiling speakers, the sound waves rattling the team’s eardrums.

**【時間戳底層協議校正中……發現毀滅性異常。】**
**[CALIBRATING LOW-LEVEL TIMESTAMP PROTOCOLS... CRITICAL ANOMALY DETECTED.]**

**【最高警告：本閘門安全系統最近一次實體開啟的內部記錄，與主資料庫中封存的官方歷史記錄，出現嚴重不一致。】**
**[MAXIMUM ALERT: INTERNAL PHYSICAL ACCESS LOGS FOR THIS UNIT DISAGREE WITH ARCHIVED MASTER RECORDS.]**

沈洛正在輸入密碼的手指猛地一頓，她原本冷靜的臉色瞬間沉了下去，抬起頭對著空氣厲聲命令：「鹽井，開放權限，把剛才那句話再具體說一次！」
Shen Luo’s fingers froze mid-cipher. Her features sharpened. She looked up at the ceiling and barked a command. "Salt Well! Open permissions! Clarify that statement. Now!"

喇叭裡的機械音沒有絲毫猶豫：
The AI didn't hesitate.

**【確認重述。最近一次實體開啟記錄時間為：12 小時前。官方主機封存記錄時間為：3 年前。兩個時間節點發生不可調和之數據衝突。】**
**[REPEATING. LAST PHYSICAL ACCESS LOG: 12 HOURS AGO. ARCHIVED MASTER LOG: 3 YEARS AGO. CONFLICT STATUS: IRRECONCILABLE.]**

這句話一出，整個鉛灰色的巨門前，陷入了一種比剛才更加令人毛骨悚然的死寂。
The statement hit the room like a concussive blast. A silence far heavier and more terrifying than before swallowed the corridor.

「不可能！這絕對不可能！」
"Impossible! That's flat-out impossible!"

軍方的見證員最先打破了沉默，他的臉色變得鐵青，甚至不顧形象地提高了音量反駁：「十二小時前，正是第十二防線拉起警報的時候。這整個底層環形廊道早就被軍方的三道重裝柵欄徹底封死了！連一隻變異的老鼠都鑽不進來，怎麼可能有人能在不觸發任何警報的情況下，來這裡開門？！」
The military Proxy broke first. His face was a mask of bruised ego and sheer panic. He raised his voice, his steady professionalism cracking. "Twelve hours ago, the entire lower sector was under Grade-A lockdown! The military had the ring corridors sealed behind three layers of heavy-duty blast gates! Not even a mutated rat could have crawled in here, let alone opened this massive door without tripping a single alarm!"

祈函站在幾步之外，把玩著袖口上那些象徵著深淵裂口的黑色絲線繡花。她淡淡地看了一眼暴怒的軍方見證員，語氣中帶著一種洞悉一切的悲憫與嘲弄：
Qi Han stood a few paces back, her fingers tracing the black silk rifts embroidered on her sleeves. She spared the military officer a single, pitying glance. Her voice was calm—infuriatingly so.

「長官，您似乎弄錯了一個根本的概念。在這個被深淵注視的地方，你們用鋼鐵和密碼封死的，從來都只是『門』，而那個東西要走的……是『路』。」
"Officer, you seem to be confusing two very different concepts. In a place watched by the Abyss, you use steel and ciphers to seal the *doors*. But the thing you are trying to hide... it only walks the *path*."
