## Chapter 1｜裂谷醒轉
# Chapter 1: Rift Awakening

凌晨兩點，第一聲警報響起的時候，不像電子合成音，更像是一把生鏽的鈍鋸片，正沿著第三十七基地的合金骨架，一層一層、不留餘地地往下刮。
The alarm didn't sound like a siren. It sounded like a rusty hacksaw systematically tearing through the alloy skeleton of Base 37.

祁渡是在這股令人牙酸的摩擦聲裡醒來的。
Alex woke up to the sound of grinding metal.

他的意識比身體先一步甦醒，首先鑽進鼻腔的是極度濃烈的焦鹽味，那是一種彷彿海水被瞬間沸騰蒸乾後留下的苦澀；緊接著是揮之不去的鐵鏽味，最後，才是連最高純度消毒劑都蓋不住的一絲隱約腐甜。
His consciousness snapped online before his body could catch up. The first thing that hit him was the smell—scorched salt, like an entire ocean boiled dry in a microsecond. Then came the copper tang of blood, barely masked by the sickeningly sweet underside of high-grade antiseptic.

他試圖睜開眼，但眼皮沉甸甸的。頭頂的冷色調導光管正處於電壓不穩的狀態，發出「劈啪」的微弱爆裂聲，白光一明一滅，刺得他瞳孔猛地收縮。視線勉強對焦後，他看見斑駁的灰色牆面上，一條原本隱形的導光條正像血管般奔流著猩紅色的字體：
He forced his eyes open against the glare. The overhead halogens were dying, spitting angry sparks and strobing raw white light into his dilated pupils. When his vision finally stopped spinning, he focused on the flaking grey wall across from him. A hidden optical conduit pulsed like an infected vein, bleeding crimson text into the air:

**B-7 區進入黑雪等級封鎖。**
**[ALERT: SECTOR B-7 AUTHORIZED FOR 'BLACK SNOW' LOCKDOWN.]**

祁渡的腦子裡有短暫的空白。B-7 是哪裡？黑雪又是什麼代號？一切概念都像在深海裡泡過一樣模糊不清。他試圖摸索自己身處的環境，手指觸碰到底下冰冷堅硬的材質——這是一張邊緣帶著束縛扣的金屬床。
Alex’s mind blanked. *Where the hell is B-7? And what kind of nightmare designation is 'Black Snow'?* His memories felt like they’d been submerged in deep water, heavy and distorted.

他低下頭，看見自己的右手腕上扣著一條半透明的臨時識別帶。微小的電子光標在上面閃爍，名字欄那一格是刺眼的空白，而身分欄則冷硬地跳動著三個字：
He moved his hands, testing his environment. Cold, unyielding steel. His fingertips brushed against heavy-duty restraint buckles built into the edges of the bed. *Not a hotel, then. Great.*

**待驗證。**
He looked down. A translucent, temporary ID band was clamped tight around his right wrist. A microscopic UI cursor blinked steadily on the curved display. The 'Name' field was glaringly empty. Below it, the 'Status' field flashed three cold words:

「醒了就立刻站起來。」
**[PENDING VERIFICATION]**

女人的聲音沒有任何溫度，像是一把精準的手術刀，直接切斷了祁渡的茫然。
"If you're awake, get up."

說話的人站在床尾三步開外，穿著一件連體式的深灰檢疫服，布料表面覆蓋著一層微光的防靜電塗層。她的胸前掛著半透明的權限名牌：沈洛。
The female voice carried zero warmth. It sliced through his confusion like a scalpel.

她沒有走近確認祁渡的生命跡象，也沒有任何安撫的意圖，只是隔著這絕對安全的社交距離，將一個密封的透明袋精準地丟到他手邊的床沿。袋子裡裝著祁渡的黑色外套，還有一枚錶盤已經徹底碎裂、指針彎曲的機械腕錶。
The speaker stood exactly three paces from the foot of the bed. She wore a dark grey, one-piece quarantine suit coated in an anti-static sheen. A semitransparent clearance badge hung from her chest: **Shen Luo**.

「你有三分鐘穿好衣服。」沈洛的視線越過他，看向牆上瘋狂閃動的紅燈，「封鎖等級剛才又往上提了一級，這層樓十分鐘內要徹底清空。」
She didn't approach to check his vitals. She offered no reassurance. Maintaining her perfectly calculated biological safety distance, she tossed a sealed, transparent synth-bag onto the edge of his bed. Inside was Alex's black jacket and a mechanical watch—its face entirely shattered, the hands bent beyond repair.

祁渡沒有多問，他單手撐著冰冷的金屬床沿，咬牙讓有些僵硬的雙腿落地。然而，靴底剛一接觸地面，一種極度怪異的發麻感瞬間從腳底竄上脊椎——就像是赤腳踩在一片極細的碎砂石上。
"You have three minutes to dress," Shen Luo said. Her eyes bypassed him entirely, locked onto the frantically pulsing red strobe on the wall. "The lockdown level just escalated again. This entire floor is being purged in ten minutes."

他立刻低頭。地板是不鏽鋼的無縫材質，乾淨得能照出人影，什麼都沒有。但他稍微挪動腳步，卻能清晰地聽見鞋底與某種看不見的微小顆粒摩擦的聲音，「沙沙、沙沙」，那聲音像是貼著他的鼓膜在響。
Alex didn't bother asking questions. He leveraged his weight against the freezing steel frame, gritting his teeth as his stiff boots hit the floor. But the very second his soles made contact, a bizarre, static numbness shot straight up his spine.

「這裡是醫療艙？」祁渡一邊套上冷硬的外套，一邊抬頭確認沈洛的反應。
It felt exactly like stepping barefoot onto extremely fine gravel.

沈洛終於把視線轉移到他臉上，眼神像是在評估一件隨時可能報廢的儀器：「現在是檢疫前室。至於其他的問題，等你能活過接下來的十分鐘再問。」
He snapped his gaze downward. The seamless stainless steel floor was spotless enough to reflect his face. There was absolutely nothing there. Yet, when he shifted his weight, he clearly heard the distinct, dry rustle of his boots grinding against invisible particulate. *Scrape. Scrape.* The sound echoed directly against his eardrums.

話音未落，外頭的走廊突然傳來一連串沉悶的撞門聲。「砰！砰砰！」那力道極大，震得牆壁上的導光條閃爍得更加頻繁。
"Is this a medical bay?" Alex asked, violently shrugging into the stiff jacket. He watched her for any micro-expressions.

有人在外面嘶啞地喊叫。一開始還能聽出完整的句子，但在極度的恐懼中，聲音很快撕裂，詞語的排列順序也徹底崩潰，到最後只剩下幾個不成調的重複音節：
Shen Luo finally shifted her gaze to his face. She looked at him the way a mechanic evaluates a machine inches from total failure. "This is a Quarantine Antechamber. As for your other questions—save them until you manage to survive the next ten minutes."

「開門！名字……給我名字……名字！」
Before she even finished her sentence, a series of muffled impacts hammered against the heavy corridor door outside.

那聲音帶有極強的感染力，像一雙手死死掐住了祁渡的呼吸道。
*Bang! Bang-bang!*

沈洛立刻按住頸後的隱藏式通訊耳機，她的語速驟然變快，帶著軍方特有的冷酷與決斷：「B-7 名冊剛才又變動了？撤離隊現在缺三個名額。立刻截斷 C 區的匯流閘。」
The force was staggering, rattling the walls and making the crimson conduit lights flicker violently. Someone outside was screaming. It started as coherent sentences, but under the weight of sheer, paralyzing terror, the voice tore. The syntax collapsed, devolving into a frantic, repetitive loop of broken syllables:

切斷通訊後，她轉頭看向祁渡。那種眼神不是看著一個活人，而像是在確認一件物流貨物的完損狀態。
*"Open up! My name... give me my name... NAME!"*

「你，跟我走。」她果斷下令。
The raw panic in the voice was contagious. It felt like an invisible hand clamping down on Alex's windpipe.

「我在撤離名單裡？」祁渡敏銳地捕捉到了關鍵詞。
Shen Luo's hand flew to the concealed comms unit behind her ear. Her speaking pace doubled, exuding the cold, ruthless efficiency of military brass. "The B-7 manifest changed *again*? Evacuation squad is down three slots. Sever the C-Sector confluence gate. Now."

「你『本來』在。」沈洛大步走到門邊的金屬操控台，將她手腕上的終端屏幕投影在半空中，並粗暴地翻轉角度，讓祁渡看清楚。
She killed the feed and turned back to Alex. The look in her eyes confirmed it: he wasn't a living breathing human. He was a cargo asset, and she was assessing the damage.

投影畫面是一份密密麻麻的電子名冊。在螢光綠的字句中，有一行字剛剛被一道猩紅的橫線無情地劃掉，那條線刺眼得像是拿刀直接在祁渡眼皮上割開的傷口：
"You. With me," she ordered.

~~**祁渡，A 通道撤離。**~~
"Am I on the evacuation list?" Alex zeroed in on the critical intel.

而在這道被抹殺的紀錄正下方，一行全新生成的冰冷字眼正閃爍著刺目的白光：
"You *were*." Shen Luo strode to the metal console by the door. She flicked her wrist terminal, projecting a holographic interface into the air, and aggressively angled it so Alex could see.

**祁渡，留置觀察。**
It was an electronic manifest, packed with dense text. Amidst the neon green lines, one specific entry had just been brutally slashed through with a crimson line. It looked like a fresh knife wound.

「誰改的權限？」祁渡的聲音沉了下來，盯著那四個字。
~~**[QI DU. EVACUATION ROUTE A.]**~~

沈洛沒有回答這個問題。她反手按滅了投影，光芒驟收的瞬間，她從口袋裡抽出一張純黑色的高密度過濾口罩，用力擲進祁渡懷裡。
Directly beneath his deleted existence, a newly generated string of text flashed in blinding white:

「從現在開始，把口罩戴上。沒有我的允許，一個字都不要說。」她一把按下氣閘門的開啟鍵，沉重的金屬門發出刺耳的洩壓聲，「在黑雪期裡，這座基地連『詞彙』都會生病。」
**[QI DU. DETAIN AND OBSERVE.]**

厚重的氣閘門完全敞開，兩人剛並肩踏出檢疫前室，基地的照明系統毫無預警地發出一聲慘烈的嗡鳴——燈光全滅。
"Who overrode my clearance?" Alex’s voice dropped an octave, his eyes locked onto the projection. *Someone just sentenced me to death, and I don't even know my own name.*

整整一秒鐘的絕對黑暗。
Shen Luo didn't answer. She slapped the projection off. In the sudden absence of localized light, she yanked a high-density, pitch-black filtration mask from her pocket and threw it hard against Alex's chest.

那一秒裡，祁渡聽見了遠處傳來類似某種龐然大物在金屬管線中爬行的迴音。接著，備用電源啟動，走廊重新亮起，但光線不再是慘白，而是一種令人極度不安的黯淡冷藍色。
"Put that on. Keep it on," she snapped, hammering the release key for the airlock. The heavy metal doors hissed violently as they depressurized. "Do not say a single word unless I explicitly tell you to. During a Black Snow event, in this base, even *vocabulary* can get infected."

就像整個空間、連同他們呼吸的空氣，都被浸泡進了某種黏稠的藍色福馬林液體中。
The massive airlock parted. The exact second they stepped side-by-side out of the antechamber, the base's primary lighting system let out a single, agonizing whine—and died.

祁渡本能地轉頭，看向走廊左側那一長排厚重的防爆玻璃窗。窗外沒有風景，只有無盡的深淵，而現在，深淵裡正在下雪。
Total darkness. One full, suffocating second.

那不是正常的白雪，也不是雨。那是像燒焦的煤灰，又像是被碾成極細微粉末的骨灰，呈現出一種吞噬一切光線的漆黑。這些黑色的細片沒有隨風飛舞，而是詭異地、緊緊地貼在外牆的防爆玻璃上，像是一層有生命的菌毯，正緩慢地、蠕動著向下攀爬。
In that pitch black, Alex heard an echo from deep down the corridor. It sounded like something impossibly massive dragging itself through the metal ventilation shafts. Then, emergency generators kicked in. The corridor lit up, but not with harsh white light. It was a dim, sickly, terrifyingly cold blue.

祁渡的視線被那些蠕動的黑色粉末死死攫住，大腦深處彷彿響起了一陣奇異的白噪音，讓他一時間忘記了呼吸，腳步也不自覺地慢了下來。
It felt as if the entire hallway, the very oxygen they were breathing, had been submerged in a vat of viscous, blue formaldehyde.

「別盯著看！」
Instinctively, Alex turned his head toward the long row of reinforced blast windows lining the left wall. There was no scenery outside. Just the endless abyss.

一隻手猛地扯住祁渡的外套領口，極大的力道將他整個人往回拽。沈洛的臉近在咫尺，眼神裡有一種看見某種極度危險物體的警告意味。
And right now, it was snowing in the abyss.

祁渡猛地回神，這才發現自己剛才差一點就要將整隻手掌貼到那面冰冷的玻璃上。他倒抽一口冷氣：「那到底是什麼……看久了會怎樣？」
It wasn't normal snow. It wasn't rain. It looked like scorched coal dust, or cremated bone ground into an impossibly fine powder. It was a darkness so absolute it seemed to devour ambient light. And it wasn't swirling in the wind. The black particulate was pressing itself tightly against the exterior of the blast glass, squirming and crawling downward like a living, sentient fungal mat.

沈洛重新拉開距離，一邊快步往前走，一邊冷硬地丟下答案：「看久了，外面的東西就會把你腦子裡的東西換掉。」
Alex couldn't look away. The squirming black dust hijacked his retinas. A strange, resonant white noise began to buzz in the deepest part of his cerebral cortex. He forgot to breathe. His footsteps instinctively slowed.

「換掉什麼？」
"Don't look at it!"

「先用代碼換掉你的名字，再用別人的過去，換掉你的記憶。」
A hand clamped onto the collar of his jacket, yanking him backward with brutal force. Shen Luo was inches from his face, her eyes wide with the specific kind of warning reserved for apex hazards.

他們跟著冷藍色的應急路標，剛急轉拐進主走廊的交叉口，走廊深處另一道厚重的防火門被「砰」地一聲粗暴撞開。
Alex violently snapped out of the trance. He realized with a jolt of pure adrenaline that his palm had been less than an inch from flattening itself against the freezing glass. He dragged in a sharp breath. "What the hell is that... what happens if you stare?"

一個穿著骯髒、滿是油污與不明液體痕跡的回收商背心的男人，拖著一個超過半公尺長的重型金屬工具箱衝了出來。男人的半邊臉上還沾著尚未凝固的黑灰，眼神透著一種長期在極限高壓下扭曲的亢奮。
Shen Luo didn't linger. She broke distance, walking fast and hard, tossing the answer over her shoulder. "Stare too long, and whatever is outside swaps out whatever is inside your head."

那人看見沈洛的檢疫服，先是毫不客氣地發出一聲極具嘲諷意味的低笑，隨後眼珠子一轉，視線落在了祁渡那空白的識別帶上。
"Swaps out what?"

他笑得更深了，露出一口被某種煙草薰黃的牙齒。「喲，沈大檢疫官，今天帶新貨啊？」
"First, it replaces your name with code. Then, it replaces your memories with someone else's past."

沈洛腳步沒停，冷冷地回嘴：「他是臨時人員，不歸你們回收隊管。」
Following the sickly blue emergency routing lights, they banked hard into the main corridor junction. From deep within the intersecting hall, another heavy fire door was violently kicked open with a thunderous *crash*.

「進了黑雪期的名單，死人活人臨時人，有什麼不一樣？」男人停下腳步，將手裡的重型工具箱往鋼鐵地板上重重一頓。
A man wearing a filthy scavenger’s vest, stained with grease and unidentified fluids, muscled his way out. He dragged a heavy-duty metal toolbox behind him, easily over half a meter long. Uncoagulated black soot smeared half his face, and his eyes burned with the specific, manic adrenaline of someone living permanently on the sharp edge of extreme pressure.

「哐」的一聲巨響，箱扣彈開，裡面整整齊齊、泛著冰冷金屬光澤的，全是高能激光切割頭與超低溫封裝夾——那是用來處理「不可描述之物」的專業刑具。
He took one look at Shen Luo’s quarantine suit and let out a derisive, barking laugh. Then his eyes flicked, locking onto Alex’s blank ID band.

男人挑著眉，看著沈洛：「沈洛，封鎖規程第七條怎麼寫的背給他聽聽？『先保核心設施、再保高權限人員』。你帶著一個連名字都沒有的累贅亂跑，到了最後，連你自己這身皮都保不住。」
His grin widened, revealing teeth stained yellow by cheap syntobacco. "Well, well. Chief Quarantine Officer Shen. Bringing in fresh meat today?"

祁渡瞇起眼睛，盯著男人背心胸口處那塊用劣質機器刻印的殘舊胸牌：**回收隊-段九。**
Shen Luo didn't break her stride. Her voice was ice. "He is a temporary asset. Not under Scavenger jurisdiction."

面對段九的嘲弄，沈洛連表情都沒變，反擊的速度極快：「規程第七條的後半句是『在可逆風險的條件下，允許啟動緊急避險』。段九，睜大你的狗眼看清楚警報色號，現在是不可逆，你手裡的那些破爛切割器連牆皮都保不住。」
"Once they make the Black Snow list, dead, alive, or temporary—what’s the difference?" The man stopped, slamming the massive metal toolbox down onto the steel deck.

段九嗤笑一聲，猛地「啪」一聲合上工具箱，像是聽見了一個天大的笑話。「你們軍規版本寫得真是漂亮極了，簡直可以裱起來掛在牆上。但到了這吃人的黑雪夜，誰心裡不清楚？哪次不是踩著下邊人的骨頭，先保上面那份該死的名單？」
*Clang.*

段九的話音剛落，彷彿是為了印證他的嘲諷，整條主走廊的警報聲突然毫無預警地拔高了一個八度，廣播系統裡傳出無機質的女聲，每一個字都像在宣判死刑：
The latches popped. Inside, arranged with lethal precision and gleaming with cold metallic light, sat an array of high-energy plasma laser cutters and ultra-low-temp cryogenic encapsulation clamps.

**全區強制通報：A 通道已進入不可逆污染狀態。A 通道關閉。重複，A 通道永久關閉。所有閘門鎖死。**
*Executioner's tools,* Alex realized instantly. *Designed for disposing of 'indescribable entities'.*

沈洛原本冷靜的臉色，在聽見廣播的瞬間「唰」地沉了下去，連嘴唇都抿成了一條泛白的直線。
The man arched an eyebrow at Shen Luo. "Hey, Shen. Recite Protocol Seven for the rookie, why don't you? 'Prioritize core facilities; subsequently prioritize high-clearance personnel.' You're running around with a piece of dead weight who doesn't even have a name. You keep this up, and you won't even keep the skin on your own back."

A 通道，正是剛剛在終端屏幕上，祁渡最初被分配的撤離路線。如果祁渡沒有被臨時改為「留置觀察」，如果他按原計畫走了那條路，現在他已經被永久鎖死在污染區裡了。
Alex narrowed his eyes, tracking the poorly stamped, worn nametag grafted to the man's vest: **[Scavenger Squad - Duan Jiu.]**

祁渡心裡猛地一緊，一陣寒意從脊椎骨爬上來。他看向沈洛：「A 通道關了，那我們現在走哪裡？」
Shen Luo's expression didn't shift a millimeter. Her counterattack was instant. "The second half of Protocol Seven reads: *'In the event of reversible risk, emergency evasion protocols may be initiated.'* Open your damn eyes, Duan Jiu. Check the strobe color. This is an irreversible hazard. Those garbage cutters you're hauling won't even dent the paint."

「沒有『我們』了。」沈洛站在閃爍著紅光的十字路口，語氣突然變得極度冷靜，像是在交代遺言。她轉頭看向一旁看戲的段九，「段九，你帶他去 B-3 廢棄緩衝間。我要去主控塔，把名冊的核心原檔取出來。」
Duan Jiu scoffed. He kicked the toolbox shut with a violent *snap*, acting as if she'd just told the funniest joke on the frontier. "Your military handbooks are so pretty. You should frame them. But when the Black Snow comes down to eat us alive, who doesn't know the truth? You always step on the bones of the grunts down below to save the names printed on that goddamn list."

這句話一出，段九臉上的戲謔消失了，祁渡的眼神也變了。
As if explicitly commanded to validate his cynicism, the main corridor klaxons abruptly spiked a full octave. An inorganic female voice bled from the PA system. Every syllable felt like a death sentence.

「我為什麼要跟他走？」祁渡看著段九那身沾滿不明污漬的背心，警惕地後退了半步。「他的裝備看起來不像要去逃命的。」
**[MANDATORY BASE-WIDE ALERT: EVACUATION ROUTE A HAS REACHED IRREVERSIBLE CONTAMINATION STATUS.]**

段九彎下腰，肌肉暴起，單手拎起那個沉重無比的工具箱，像拎著一塊毫無價值的廢鐵。他對著祁渡咧開嘴：「因為你現在是個幽靈。你沒有名字，沒有通行權限碼，A 通道也成了墳地。除了跟老子走死人走的路，你沒有第二條路可以選。」
**[ROUTE A SEALED. I REPEAT: ROUTE A PERMANENTLY SEALED. ALL BULKHEADS LOCKED.]**

沈洛沒有理會段九的恐嚇。她快步走到祁渡面前，毫無預兆地伸手抓過祁渡的手掌，將一枚尚帶體溫、體積極小的黑色臨時晶片強行塞進他掌心。
Shen Luo's stoic composure shattered. The color drained from her face, her lips pressing into a bloodless, white line.

她壓低聲音，用只有祁渡能聽見的音量快速說道：「記住我的話，等一下不管到了哪裡，如果有人、或者有任何『東西』問你剛才看見了什麼，你只能說一句話：『我只看見雪』。絕對、絕對不要補充任何細節。連一個標點符號都不要多說。」
Route A.

她停頓了一秒，眼神裡閃過一絲極端複雜的情緒，像是在權衡要不要將最後一句話說出來。但最終，她還是開口了，聲音低得彷彿會被警報聲隨時碾碎：
That was the exact evacuation path assigned to Alex on the terminal five minutes ago. If his status hadn't been spontaneously overridden to 'Detain and Observe', if he had followed his original route... he would be permanently sealed inside a lethal contamination zone right now.

「還有……如果你在任何監控畫面裡，看見『你自己在做一些你根本沒做過的事』，先別急著開口辯解。管好你的嘴，先活下來再說。」
Ice gripped Alex's spine. He looked at Shen Luo. "Route A is dead. Where do we go now?"

說完，她沒有給祁渡任何發問的機會，轉身一腳踹開了通往主控塔的單向防火門。門框周圍的警報紅光瞬間吞沒了她深灰色的背影，像是一滴水落進了血海裡。
"There is no 'we'."

「看夠了就走，等死嗎？」段九粗魯地撞了一下祁渡的肩膀，提著工具箱往與主控塔完全相反、一條幾乎沒有光源的黑暗廊道跑去。
Standing at the strobe-lit intersection, Shen Luo's voice dropped into a terrifying, dead calm. It sounded like a last will and testament. She turned to Duan Jiu, who had stopped laughing. "Duan Jiu. Take him to the B-3 Abandoned Buffer Room. I am going to the Main Control Tower to extract the core manifest."

祁渡只能握緊掌心的晶片，跟著段九在迷宮般錯綜複雜的基地血管中狂奔。跑動間，缺氧的感覺越來越嚴重，肺部像是有火在燒。
Duan Jiu's amusement vanished. Alex’s eyes narrowed into slits.

他們每經過一扇原本應該有明確標示的區域隔離門，祁渡就會震驚地發現，門上的封鎖警告字樣正處於一種極端不穩定的狀態。有幾扇門的跑馬燈寫著「黑雪警報」，下個轉角的門上卻顯示著「骨塵逸散」，甚至到了後面，顯示屏幕上的文字已經完全崩解，變成了一行行狂亂扭動的亂碼。
"Why the hell would I go with him?" Alex demanded, taking a half-step back from the man in the grease-stained vest. "His loadout isn't built for running."

就好像一場災難，正在被好幾套完全不相容的語言系統同時命名、同時爭奪定義權。
Duan Jiu bent down, muscle cords bulging in his arms, and hoisted the impossibly heavy toolbox like it was a piece of scrap. He bared his teeth at Alex. "Because you are a ghost right now, kid. No name, no clearance codes, and Route A is a mass grave. Unless you wanna walk the path of the dead, you don't have a second option. Follow me."

當他們終於喘著粗氣來到 B-3 緩衝間時，走廊的光線已經暗到了極點。這是一扇沒有任何編號的生鏽鐵門。
Shen Luo completely ignored Duan Jiu’s intimidation tactics. She stepped directly into Alex's personal space, grabbed his palm, and aggressively forced a tiny, black temporary chip into his hand. It was still warm from her own body heat.

段九大罵了一聲，從背心口袋抽出一張破爛的最高權限卡，在讀卡機上暴力地刷了三次。
She lowered her voice to a rapid, urgent whisper that only he could hear. "Remember exactly what I say. No matter where you end up next, if *anyone*—or *anything*—asks you what you saw outside that window, you only say four words: *'I only saw snow.'* Absolutely zero supplementary details. Do not add a single punctuation mark."

「滴——權限核准。」隨著電子音效，沉重的鐵門向兩側吃力地滑開。
She paused for a fraction of a second. A complex, raw emotion flickered in her eyes, fighting the urge to withhold the final piece of Intel.

門內沒有想像中的醫療設備或安全屋配置，只有一張斑駁的金屬桌，以及滿滿一整面牆、閃爍著無數亮點的巨型監控螢幕。這面牆像是整個基地的監視樞紐卡在了這個廢棄點。
But the words ripped out of her, low enough to be ground into dust by the blaring sirens:

監控畫面被細密地分割成了十六格，播放著基地各個角落的慘狀。祁渡幾乎是踏進房間的瞬間，視線就如遭雷擊般地死死釘在了左下角的那一格畫面上。
"And... if you see yourself on any surveillance feed doing things you *know* you didn't do... shut your mouth. Don't try to defend yourself. Just stay alive."

那一格畫面的標籤寫著：**醫療前室（檢疫）**。
She didn't leave room for questions. She pivoted and brutally kicked open the one-way fire door leading to the towering Main Control structure. The crimson emergency lights instantly swallowed her dark grey silhouette, like a single drop of blood plunging into an ocean.

那是他五分鐘前才剛離開的地方。
"You done staring? Wanna die here?" Duan Jiu violently shoulder-checked Alex, hauling the toolbox as he sprinted down a pitch-black secondary corridor in the exact opposite direction.

透過低像素的黑白鏡頭，他清清楚楚地看見了「自己」。
Alex crushed the chip tightly in his fist and ran.

畫面裡的那個祁渡，正孤單地站在那張金屬床的床沿邊。他臉上的表情木然得可怕，正以一種極其緩慢、像是由齒輪驅動般的僵硬動作抬起右手，將自己手腕上的半透明識別帶一把扯了下來。
He followed Duan Jiu into the dizzying, labyrinthine veins of the base. Oxygen grew scarce. Panic-induced hypoxia set his lungs on fire. Every time they passed what should have been a standard sector isolation door, Alex stared in mounting horror at the digital lock warnings.

然後，畫面裡的那個祁渡張開嘴，將那條識別帶塞進嘴裡，用牙齒一點一點地、瘋狂地將它咬斷、嚼碎。
They were fundamentally unstable.

現實裡的祁渡大腦轟然一響，呼吸瞬間停滯。他幾乎是下意識地、以極快的速度用左手握住自己的右手腕。
One door’s marquee flashed: **[BLACK SNOW ALERT]**. Moving past the very next junction, the panel screamed: **[BONE DUST CONTAINMENT FAILURE]**. By the time they reached the lower levels, the text had disintegrated entirely into violent, writhing gibberish.

觸感冰涼、堅硬。
It was as if the calamity currently hunting them was being simultaneously defined by multiple, incompatible realities, each violently competing for control over the narrative.

那條半透明的臨時識別帶依然牢牢地扣在他的手腕上，閃爍著微小的光標，完好無損。上面依然寫著「待驗證」三個字。
When they finally staggered into the B-3 Buffer Room, gasping for dead air, the corridor lighting was almost nonexistent. It was an unmarked, heavily rusted iron door.

「這不可能……」祁渡的聲音抖得不成樣子，手指死死摳住手腕，直到指節泛白。「那不是我。我沒有做過這種事。」
Duan Jiu cursed viciously, swiping a battered, maximum-clearance card through the reader three times with brutal force.

沈洛的警告在此刻如詛咒般在他耳邊迴響：『看見你自己在做你沒做過的事，先別急著開口辯解。』
*Beep—Access Granted.*

段九反手將沉重的鐵門徹底鎖死，並拉下了最高級別的實體隔離閘。他沒有回頭看祁渡震驚的表情，語氣平淡得像是在談論今天的天氣，卻透著一股令人毛骨悚然的絕望：
The massive iron door groaned heavily as it slid open.

「別喊了。歡迎來到裂谷邊境，菜鳥。在這裡，最先徹底壞掉的，不是裝甲牆，也不是人的肉體……而是『紀錄』。」
There was no medical gear inside. No safehouse provisions. Just a single, heavily oxidized metal table, and an entire wall composed of a massive, synchronized surveillance grid. It was an abandoned security nexus.

段九的話音剛落，整個 B-3 緩衝間的內部警報突然發出了一聲極其尖銳的短鳴。
The screen was partitioned into sixteen panels, broadcasting the live, visceral slaughter occurring across the base.

緊接著，那整面原本被分割成十六格的監控牆，畫面瞬間統一雪花閃現。一秒後，所有的監控影像全部消失，取而代之的是一行佔滿整面牆、猶如用鮮血寫下的巨大警告標語：
The absolute microsecond Alex stepped inside, his eyes locked onto the bottom-left panel as if struck by lightning.

**留置人員：祁渡。風險級別上調至極端（Level-6）。**
The label on the feed read: **[MEDICAL ANTECHAMBER (QUARANTINE)]**.

祁渡站在那行散發著刺目紅光的巨大字體前，呼吸變得沉重且冰冷。他看著屏幕上自己被強行升級的風險標籤，第一次真正、徹底地意識到了一個事實：
It was the exact room he had vacated five minutes ago.

今天晚上之後，他不僅失去了名字，而且，他可能再也回不到任何一份正常人的名單裡了。
Through the low-res, black-and-white lens, he clearly saw *himself*.

The Alex on the monitor was standing utterly alone beside that steel bed. His expression was horrifyingly hollow. Moving with the stiff, unnatural rigidity of a clockwork automaton, the thing on the screen slowly lifted its right hand and violently tore the translucent ID band off its own wrist.

Then, the Alex on the screen opened his mouth, shoved the reinforced band between his teeth, and began to frantically chew it to pieces.

A concussive roar erupted in Alex's actual brain. His lungs seized.

Operating purely on primal instinct, his left hand shot across his body, clamping onto his right wrist.

*Cold. Hard.*

His actual, physical ID band was still strapped tightly around his wrist, its micro-cursor blinking steadily. Completely unharmed.

The three words were still there: **[PENDING VERIFICATION]**.

"That... that's impossible..." Alex's voice trembled violently, his fingernails digging so hard into his own wrist his knuckles turned white. "That isn't me. I didn't do that."

Shen Luo's curse of a warning echoed in his skull: *If you see yourself doing things you know you didn't do, shut your mouth.*

Duan Jiu slammed his weight against the iron door, sealing it shut before violently pulling down the manual, max-level quarantine lever. He didn't even look over his shoulder at Alex's shattered expression.

His voice was terrifyingly calm, stating a horrifying fact like discussing the weather.

"Stop yelling. Welcome to the Rift Frontier, rookie. Out here, the first thing that breaks isn't the armor plating or human meat... It's the *records*."

The exact moment Duan Jiu finished his sentence, the B-3 Buffer Room’s internal klaxon let out an ear-piercing shriek.

The massive sixteen-panel surveillance wall aggressively scrambled into synchronized static. One second later, the video feeds died completely. In their place, a single, gigantic warning blared across the entire wall. It looked like it had been written in fresh blood:

**[DETAINED PERSONNEL: QI DU.]**

**[RISK LEVEL ESCALATED TO EXTREME: LEVEL-6.]**

Alex stood frozen before the massive, blinding red text. His breathing turned slow and freezing cold. Staring at his forcibly rigged threat classification, the brutal reality of the frontier finally sank in.

Tonight, he hadn't just lost his name.

If he survived this, he was never going back onto a normal human registry ever again.
