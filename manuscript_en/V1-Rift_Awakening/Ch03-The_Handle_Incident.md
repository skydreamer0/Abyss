## Chapter 3｜把手事件
# Chapter 3: The Handle Incident

當那名滿臉是血的失名者，像一頭撞破了牢籠的野獸般衝進 E 區外廊時，整個原本還勉強維持著秩序表象的檢疫區，瞬間就像是一口被人從內部暴烈掀開蓋子的高壓鍋。
When the bleeding, nameless wreck of a man burst into the Sector E corridor like an animal breaking its cage, the thin veneer of order in the quarantine zone didn't just crack. It exploded like a pressure cooker having its lid ripped off from the inside.

沸騰的亂象在不到三秒鐘內徹底引爆。
Total chaos detonated in less than three seconds.

刺耳的警報聲幾乎要劈開所有人的耳膜，走廊頂端的應急照明燈瘋狂閃爍著毫無節奏的紅光，將每一個奔逃者的影子拉扯得無比倒錯而猙獰。
The shriek of the alarms was enough to split eardrums. Emergency strobes in the ceiling pulsed with a manic, rhythmic red, stretching the shadows of the fleeing crowds into grotesque, twisted shapes against the steel.

各方勢力的應對速度快得令人咋舌，但也將這座基地內部長期潛伏的利益撕裂得淋漓盡致。
The response from the various factions was blindingly fast, but it also stripped away the mask of unity, exposing the jagged, competing interests that had always lurked beneath the surface of Base 37.

反應最直接的，是常駐檢疫區的軍方防暴小隊。六名穿著重型動力外骨骼的士兵幾乎是瞬間結陣，沉重的軍靴重重跺在金屬地板上，發出令人牙酸的摩擦聲。黑洞洞的電磁步槍槍口在同一時間拉平，紅外線瞄準點密密麻麻地鎖定了失名者的軀幹。
The military’s riot squad moved first. Six soldiers encased in heavy-duty powered exoskeletons snapped into a tactical formation, their weighted boots thudding against the deck with a bone-jarring metallic resonance. A phalanx of electromagnetic rifles leveled instantly, a hive of red laser dots swarming over the nameless man's torso.

軍方頻道裡飆出指揮官毫無溫度的四個字命令，透過擴音器砸向整個走廊：
A command, four syllables long and entirely devoid of human heat, crackled over the PA system:

**「就地處決。」**
**"TERMINATE ON SIGHT."**

然而，軍方的陣型才剛推進不到五公尺，另一側的通道就被一群穿著純白長袍的人死死堵住。那是教團的清道夫。他們甚至沒有攜帶致命武器，而是由四個高壯的男人合力抬著一個表面刻滿了抑制符文、散發著幽藍色冷光的沉重活體收容箱。
They hadn't advanced five meters before the opposing corridor was choked by a wall of flowing white robes. The Cleaners of the Order. They didn't carry rifles; instead, four massive men hauled a heavy cryogenic containment unit. Its surface was etched with intricate suppression runes that hummed with a sickly blue bioluminescence.

帶頭的主祭司不僅不退讓，反而迎著軍方的槍口大步向前，口號喊得近乎狂熱：
The High Priest leading the charge didn't flinch at the sight of military barrels. He stepped directly into the line of fire, his voice pitched in a fanatical fever:

**「他是被深淵選中的活體標本！完整收容！不計代價完整收容！」**
**"HE IS A LIVING SPECIMEN CHOSEN BY THE ABYSS! SECURE HIM INTACT! CONTAIN AT ALL COSTS!"**

而在這極度混難、劍拔弩張的兩極對抗中，段九帶領的那群穿著油污背心的回收商，卻是最安靜、也最讓人膽寒的一批人。他們不知何時已經戴上了隔絕氣味的黑色防毒面罩，猶如隱沒在陰影裡的鬣狗，早已經在側門的死角處架好了一台滿是改裝痕跡的移動封裝架。
And then there were the Scavengers. Led by Duan Jiu, this grease-stained crew was the quietest of the bunch, and by far the most unnerving. They’d already dawned their pitch-black gas masks, lurking in the alcoves like hyenas in the brush. They didn't shout slogans. They didn't care about the chain of command. They just calibrated their jury-rigged extraction frames.

他們不喊任何口號，也不在乎這是一場什麼層級的災難。那雙躲在鏡片後的冷酷眼睛，只在反覆評估一個問題：眼前這個正在異變的目標，切下來的哪一塊器官最值錢。
To them, this wasn't a tragedy or a military failure. It was a harvest. Their cold eyes, shielded by goggles, were busy calculating a single objective: which organ in that mutating body would fetch the highest price on the black market.

祁渡剛剛經歷過白燈室的生死一瞬，現在正被沈洛死死拽著，被迫夾在軍方、教團與黑市這三方勢力形成的火藥桶正中間。
Alex, still vibrating from his near-death experience in the White Light Room, was being dragged along by Shen Luo. He was caught dead center in a three-way standoff—a powder keg where the military, the Order, and the Scavengers were all holding the matches.

這是他有生以來第一次如此直觀、如此血淋淋地看見，一整套號稱堅不可摧的基地「防禦流程」，是如何在絕對的災厄與利益面前，被各方勢力當場撕得粉碎。
It was the first time in his life—or what he could remember of it—that he'd seen the 'Invincible Containment Protocols' of the base for what they really were: a joke. Faced with a real calamity, the system was being torn to shreds by pure, unadulterated greed.

不遠處，那名失名者發出一聲非人的低泣聲。他狂暴地一頭撞翻了一整排停放著醫療器械的不鏽鋼推車。手術刀、止血鉗、還有成打的高濃度消毒液伴隨著器械碰撞的巨響全砸在地上。
Nearby, the nameless man let out a sound that wasn't a human sob. It was a guttural, wet whine. He lunged, shoulder-checking a row of stainless steel medical carts. Scalpels, clamps, and dozens of bottles of high-concentration antiseptic crashed to the deck in a cacophony of shattering glass and clattering steel.

暗紅色的新鮮血液與刺鼻的藍色消毒液瞬間混合在一起，在地板上蔓延開來，讓整個金屬走廊滑得像淋了一層厚厚的機油。
Fresh, dark blood bled into the pungent blue of the antiseptic, spreading across the floor until the entire corridor was as slick as a garage floor covered in grease.

祁渡死死盯著那個失名者。他發現對方的動作已經完全脫離了人類的神經反射。他的肌肉不再協調，更像是一具被某種高維度的錯誤代碼強行驅動的劣質機械。
Alex couldn't look away from the nameless man. The subject's movements were... wrong. It wasn't just panic. His muscles weren't firing in human sequences. He moved with the disjointed, twitchy coordination of a machine possessed by corrupted code.

最可怕的不是他的破壞力，而是他身上的某種「特質」：他跌跌撞撞地衝向哪裡，那一側原本閃爍著紅燈的重型電子隔離鎖，就會像遭遇了極強的電磁脈衝一樣，發出一陣焦躁的雜音，然後短暫地跳轉成代表通行的綠燈。
But the true horror wasn't his violence; it was the 'presence' he radiated. Everywhere he stumbled, the heavy electronic isolation locks flared with static. They buzzed with a frantic, electronic screech and—against all logic—swapped from a secure red to a permissive green.

就像是，這個基地本身的安全系統，正在為他開門。
*It's like the base security system is opening the doors for him.* Alex thought, a chill racing down his spine.

「全部停止射擊！別射他的頭！」沈洛在震耳欲聾的混亂中，幾乎是把對講機捏碎了，對著軍方頻道聲嘶力竭地吼叫，「他身上現在可能帶著最高級別的污染觸發標！只要腦脊液一炸開，這層樓的空氣系統會在三秒內被徹底感染！」
"CEASE FIRE! DO NOT SHOOT THE HEAD!" Shen Luo screamed into her comms unit, her knuckles white as she practically crushed the device. "He might be carrying a high-yield contamination trigger! If his cerebrospinal fluid atomizes, the air filtration in this entire sector will be lethal in three seconds!"

通訊器那一頭，軍方指揮官的回覆比冰塊還要冷硬，且不容置疑：「沈洛檢疫官，防禦底線不能退！如果不現在處決他，他就會衝進主控區。到時候，不是這層樓，而是整個三十七基地都要給他陪葬！」
The commander's reply was as cold as a grave. "Officer Shen, the line must be held. If he breaches the Primary Control Hub, it won't just be this floor. We'll be burying the entire base. Terminate."

「砰！」一聲沉悶的電磁槍響，一發子彈精準地打穿了失名者的大腿。飛濺的血肉在地板上拖出一條觸目驚心的紅痕，但那人只是稍微踉蹌了一下，竟然感覺不到任何痛楚般，以更扭曲的姿態繼續往前爬。
*THWIP.* 

A muffled electromagnetic round punched through the nameless man's thigh. Blood sprayed, leaving a gruesome smear across the deck, but the subject didn't even scream. He didn't even slow down. He just kept crawling forward with a disjointed, unnatural gait, as if the concept of pain had been deleted from his brain.
